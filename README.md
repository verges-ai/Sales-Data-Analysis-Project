3. **Key Insights**: Provided actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

### Tools:

### Key Insights:

1. **Top Products**: Certain **PRODUCTLINE** categories are generating significantly more revenue than others. Focus on these product lines to drive more sales.
   
2. **Sales Trends**: Sales appear to be increasing steadily over time. It is important to identify the months with the highest and lowest sales to optimize inventory.

3. **Territory Insights**: Sales performance is higher in some territories. Focus on marketing and promotional efforts in these regions.

4. **Customer Insights**: A small group of customers contribute to the majority of the sales. Consider loyalty programs or offers to retain these customers.

### Recommendations:

1. **Target High-Performing Territories**: Focus your marketing campaigns on regions with high sales, and explore opportunities in underperforming areas.
2. **Improve Customer Retention**: Given that a few customers contribute most sales, build strategies to retain and upsell them.
3. **Optimize Inventory for Top-Selling Products**: Ensure you stock enough of your top-selling products, especially in peak sales months.
